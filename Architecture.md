# Driver Safety Platform — Key Components

- **Embedded Camera Module** (driver & road)  
- **Speed and Motion Sensors**  
- **Environmental Sensors** (optional)  
- **AI Backend** (vision + behavioral models)  
- **n8n Workflow Automation**  
- **Alert Engine**  
- **Database / Storage Layer**  
- **Real-time UI Dashboard**
  
Sensors and vision feed AI in the cloud → AI turns raw signals into insights → Insights trigger automated actions → Actions roll up into a clear driver safety and risk dashboard.
