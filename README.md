# Driver_Safety_Platform
The Driver Safety Platform is an intelligent AI-powered driver monitoring solution.
It combines an embedded module, advanced AI analysis, an automated n8n workflow, and a web dashboard designed for insurers, fleet managers, and families.

The goal: reduce accidents through continuous monitoring of driver behavior and road conditions.

#1. The Problem 
-Accidents caused by:
-distraction
-fatigue
-overspeeding
Additional issues:
-No tools capable of analyzing driving behavior in real time
-Insurers and companies lack reliable incident data
-Existing solutions rely too much on the driver (manual processes)
➡️ There is a need for an automatic, autonomous, and intelligent system.

#2. Our Solution: Driver Safety Platform 
A complete platform composed of:

🔹 1. Embedded Module
-Driver-facing dashcam (fatigue, distraction)
-Road-facing camera (obstacles, safe distance monitoring)
-Telematic sensors (speed, harsh braking, impact detection)

🔹 2. AI Backend
-Image analysis (Vision AI)
-Dangerous behavior detection
-Road obstacle detection
-Safety Score calculation
-Automatic alert generation

🔹 3. Automated n8n Workflow
-Data simulation or ingestion
-AI processing
-Real-time scoring
-Instant alerts
-Sheets / Database logging

🔹 4. Web Dashboard
-Global driver score
-Recent alerts
-Vehicle status
-Trip history
-AI recommendations

#3. System Architecture
Cameras & Sensors → AI (Vision + GPT) → n8n Workflow → Web Dashboard

#4. Impact – Insurance, Fleets, Families
-Reduced accidents
-Lower insurance costs
-24/7 automatic monitoring
-Eco-driving coaching
-Early detection of mechanical issues
-Increased safety for families and businesses
