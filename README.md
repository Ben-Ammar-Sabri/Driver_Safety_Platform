## 1.  The Problem

Road accidents are commonly caused by:  
- Driver distraction  
- Fatigue  
- Overspeeding  

Additional challenges include:  
- Lack of real-time driving behavior analysis tools  
- Insurers and companies lacking reliable incident data  
- Existing solutions depending too much on manual driver input  

➡️ **There is a strong need for an automatic, autonomous, and intelligent driver safety system.**
