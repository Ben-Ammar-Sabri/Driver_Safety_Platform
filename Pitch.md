# 🚗 Driver Safety Platform

Hello everyone,  

Today, I’m excited to give you a quick overview of our **Driver Safety Platform** — an AI-powered system designed to enhance road safety by monitoring driving behavior and environmental risks in real time.

Our mission is simple: **reduce accidents** by providing drivers, families, fleets, and insurers with an automatic and reliable way to track safety.

The platform is built around three key components:

### 1. Embedded Hardware Module
- Cameras and sensors inside the vehicle  
- Detects driver distraction, fatigue, speed, harsh braking, and potential road hazards  
- In the prototype, all data is simulated

### 2. AI Backend
- Processes all incoming data  
- Vision models analyze the driver and the road  
- Behavioral algorithms compute a **Safety Score** representing risk levels  
- Alerts are triggered immediately if the score drops below a threshold

### 3. n8n Automation Workflow
- Automates the entire data flow  
- Receives simulated sensor data, sends it to the AI, calculates scores, logs events, and manages alerts  
- Fully autonomous operation

Finally, our **dashboard** provides clear visibility: real-time scores, alerts, trip history, vehicle status, and AI recommendations.

The **Driver Safety Platform** is scalable, low-cost, and ready to integrate with real telematic sensors.  

**Next step:** connect an actual dashcam and sensors to make a fully operational safety system.
