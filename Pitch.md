Hello everyone,
Today, I’m excited to give you a quick overview of our Driver Safety Platform — an AI-powered system designed to enhance road safety by analyzing driving behavior and environmental risks in real time.
Our mission is simple: reduce accidents by giving drivers, families, fleets, and insurers an automatic and reliable way to monitor safety.
The platform is built around three key components. First, an embedded hardware module inside the vehicle: cameras and sensors that detect driver distraction, fatigue, speed, harsh braking, and potential road dangers. For now, this data is simulated in our prototype.
Second, our AI backend processes all incoming data. Vision models analyze the driver and the road, while behavioral algorithms compute a Safety Score representing risk levels. If the score drops below a threshold, the system immediately triggers an alert.
The third component is n8n, which automates the entire data flow. It receives simulated sensor data, sends it to the AI, calculates the score, logs events, and manages alerts — fully autonomously.
Finally, our dashboard provides clear visibility: real‑time scores, alerts, trip history, vehicle status, and AI recommendations.
The Driver Safety Platform is scalable, low‑cost, and ready to connect to real telematic sensors. Our next step is integrating an actual dashcam and hardware to build a fully operational safety device.
